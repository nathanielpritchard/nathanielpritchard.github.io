I am currently a post-doctoral associate at MIT, supervised by <a href="tamarabroderick.com">Tamara Broderick</a>


I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at Wharton where I was supervised by <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/edgeorge/">Ed George</a> and Veronika Rockova.
Prior to that, I studied mathematics at MIT and spent a year at Jesus College, Cambridge as part of the (now sadly defunct!) Cambridge-MIT Exchange program.
