<b> Abstract </b> : 
The Gaussian chain graph model simultaneously parametrizes (i) the direct effect of each of p predictors on each of q outcomes and (ii) the residual partial covariance for each pair of outcomes.
We introduce a new method for fitting sparse Gaussian chain graph models with spike-and-slab LASSO (SSL) priors. 
We develop an Expectation Conditional Maximization algorithm to obtain sparse estimates of the p x q matrix of direct effects and the q x q residual precision matrix.
Our algorithm iteratively solves a sequence of penalized maximum likelihood problems with self-adaptive penalties that gradually filter out negligible regression coefficients and partial covariances. 
Because it adaptively penalizes individual model parameters, our method is seen to outperform fixed-penalty competitors on simulated data.
We establish the posterior contraction rate for our model, buttressing our method's excellent empirical performance with strong theoretical guarantees. 
We use our method to reanalyze a dataset from a study of the effects of diet and residence type on the composition of the gut microbiome of elderly adults.
