I am currently a post-doctoral associate at MIT, supervised by <a href="www.tamarabroderick.com">Tamara Broderick</a>.
My research interests include Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Bayesian regression trees, model selection, causal inference, and applications in public health and sports.

I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at Wharton where I supervised by <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/edgeorge/">Ed George</a> and <a href = "https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/veronika.rockova/"><Veronika Rockova</a>.
Prior to that, I studied mathematics at MIT and spent a year at Jesus College, Cambridge as part of the Cambridge-MIT Exchange.
