I am currently a post-doctoral associate at MIT, supervised by Tamara Broderick.
Prior to MIT, I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at Wharton where I supervised by Ed George and Veronika Rockova.
My research interests include Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Bayesian regression trees, model selection, causal inference, and applications in public health and sports.

More about me
======

Before Wharton, I studied mathematics at MIT and spent a year at Jesus College, Cambridge as part of the (now sadly defunct) Cambridge-MIT Exchange.
When I'm not thinking about statistics, I enjoy cooking, making cocktails, photography, and watching sports (esp. Dallas teams!).
