This observational study used data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which has followed a random sample of high school graduates from the class of 1957.
Using a combination of matching, covariance adjustment, and multiple control groups, we found no evidence of clinically or statistically significant adverse effects of playing football on different measures of cognitive and mental health at ages 65 and 72 in this cohort.
